# Workshop: Typeahead

This workshop challenges you to build a common reusable component: The **Typeahead**.

Also called an **Autocomplete**, this component is designed to give users suggestions as they type, and allow the user to pick between the presented options.

Here's a finished working demo:

![working demo](./__lecture/assets/typeahead-mouse-demo.gif)

## Exercise 1: Initial structure

This workshop comes with some data - in particular, it's an array of books. Many of them are wonderful, and are worth checking out. Especially for folks who are into sci-fi/fantasy!

Inside our `App.js`, we're importing that data. Check out `data.js` to see what it looks like. We'll want to pass `data.books` down to a new Typeahead component, so that the user can filter through this big list of books and find the one they're looking for.

Start by creating a new `Typeahead.js` component. As props, it should take:

- `data` - an array of objects representing all possible suggestions.
- `handleSelect` - a function that will be called when the user picks a suggestion.

Render it inside the main component, `App`:

```diff
import data from '../data';

+import Typeahead from './Typeahead';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <GlobalStyles />
      <Wrapper>
+       <Typeahead
+         suggestions={data.books}
+         handleSelect={(suggestion) => {
+           window.alert(suggestion)
+         }}
+       >
      </Wrapper>
    </>
  )
}
```

For now, our `handleSelect` function opens an alert dialog with the name of the book we've selected.

Inside our `Typeahead` component, let's start by creating an input. You should use React state to track the value the user has entered. You can also add a "Clear" button, which will reset this value.

When the user presses "enter" in this input, we'll submit the suggestion. **For now, just return what the user has typed in, without checking anything**.

Give this a shot, and then continue reading to see one approach.

_HINT:_ you'll want to use an `onKeyDown` event, and take a look at `ev.key` to see which key the user pressed.

Your code should look something like this:

```jsx
const Typeahead = ({ suggestions, handleSelect }) => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("");

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={value}
        onChange={ev => setValue(ev.target.value)}
        onKeyDown={ev => {
          if (ev.key === "Enter") {
            handleSelect(ev.target.value);
          }
        }}
      />

      <button onClick={() => setValue("")}>Clear</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

We're using the `value` / `onChange` combo we've seen to copy a form value into React state. We're also using the same `setValue` function to reset the state when the user clicks on the "clear" button.

When the user presses a key on their keyboard, we check and see if it's the "Enter" key; if so, we call the handle submit function. You should get an Alert with the first book's title.

While we're here, we should also style the input and button to match the designs:

![initial design](./__lecture/assets/initial-design.png)

## Exercise 2: Showing and picking suggestions

When the user types in the input, we want to check and see if any of the suggestions match.

Here are some rules:

#### It should be case insensitive

Given a title "The Girls":

✅ "The"
✅ "the"

#### It should look for matches anywhere in the word

Given a title "The Girls":

✅ "The"
✅ "the G"
✅ "irls"
⛔️ "The Guys"

#### The user should have entered at least 2 letters

Given a title "The Girls":

✅ "The"
✅ "Th"
⛔️ "T"

Start by trying to render a list of the matches below the input:

![working demo](./__lecture/assets/unstyled-filtered-items.png)

Most of these results have the word "the" in them explicitly. The third item, "Technically Wrong", has it hidden in the word "oTHEr".

You should use a `<ul>` and `<li>`.

> HINT: You'll want to use `filter` to winnow down the list of suggestions, and then use `map` to render an `<li>` for each matched result.

Next, we'll need to be able to tell when the user selects one of the suggestions. There are two ways this can happen:

- The user can click on one of the suggestions
- The user can press "Enter" on their keyboard to select the currently selected suggestion.

We'll solve that second case a little further on. For now, let's add a hover state and an `onClick` event. This event should call the `handleSelect` prop with the current suggestion's title.

Give it a shot, and then check the solution below:

.

..

...

....

.....

......

.......

......

.....

....

...

..

.

```jsx
const Typeahead = ({ suggestions, handleSelect }) => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("");

  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={value}
        onChange={ev => setValue(ev.target.value)}
        onKeyDown={ev => {
          /* unchanged */
        }}
      />
      <ul>
        {matchedSuggestions.map(suggestion => {
          return (
            <li
              key={suggestion.id}
              onClick={() => handleSelect(suggestion.title)}
            >
              {suggestion.title}
            </li>
          );
        })}
      </ul>
    </Wrapper>
  );
};
```

After you have the logic working, add some styles to match the mockup. You can add a subtle yellow background on hover to indicate which option is selected:

![working demo](./__lecture/assets/suggestion-init-styles.png)

To do this, you'll want to use styled-components. You can create a new `Suggestion` component:

```jsx
// Inside your component, replacing the `<li>`:
<Suggestion key={suggestion.id} onClick={() => handleSelect(suggestion.title)}>
  {suggestion.title}
</Suggestion>;

// further down:
const Suggestion = styled.li`
  // styles here, including hover styles.
`;
```

---

## Exercise 3: Conditional rendering

You may have noticed, after adding some styling, that a weird artifact is shown when there are no suggestions:

![initial design](./__lecture/assets/always-visible.gif)

This is because we're _always rendering_ the list of results!

Figure out whether or not we have any matched suggestions, and use that to determine whether to render or not

> HINT: You don't need a new piece of state to track this; you can use the # of results.

---

## Exercise 4: Formatting the matches

Amazon and other websites make it easy to find where your search term is within the suggestion. For example, see how Amazon bolds the rest of their suggestion?

![Amazon bolding suggestions](./__lecture/assets/amazon.png)

Let's do the same thing. We'll need to split the matched suggestion's title into 2 pieces, to do something like this:

```jsx
// Given a search term "Dea", and the suggestion "Dear girls":
<span>
  Dea
  <Prediction>r girls</Prediction>
</span>;

// And then, further down:
const Prediction = styled.span`
  font-weight: bold;
`;
```

In your app, both of these will be variables:

```jsx
<span>
  {firstHalf}
  <Prediction>{secondHalf}</Prediction>
</span>
```

Your goal will be to find the index of that cross-over point (in this example, it's `3`, since the first half includes indices 0 through 2).

We should see the "prediction" part of the string bolded:

![working demo](./__lecture/assets/bolded.png)

> HINT: there are a number of ways to solve this, but you can use `indexOf` and `slice` to create the two string segments

Finally, we also want to show the associated categories with each item:

![working demo](./__lecture/assets/category-render.png)

We have all of the category data in our `data.js` file, imported in `App.js`. Pass the full set of categories as a prop to `Typeahead`.

While mapping through each `matchedSuggestion`, use the suggestion's `categoryId` to look up the relevant category object, and render its title, using purple italics.

## Exercise 5: Keyboard Navigation

Right now, our typeahead only works when using a mouse. This UI will not work for keyboard users, nor will it work for users who use a screen reader. It's important to make sure the stuff we build works well for users with disabilities.

Let's tackle keyboard navigation first.

The good news is, we get some of this for free. Browsers will fire the "onClick" event on buttons when you press "Enter" on them. Out of the box, we should be able to type a few letters, press "Tab" to move focus to the "Clear" button, and press "Enter" to clear the typed characters.

What should the ideal behaviour be? You might think that we should use the "Tab" key to move between every suggestion in the list, but this actually isn't the best practice. Instead, we want the user to be able to use the _arrow keys_. When the user is focused on the input, to move between suggestions. This is the best practice because it means that users don't have to tab through _every single suggestion_ just to get on with their page navigation. For some users, keypresses are strenuous, so we should try and minimize them.

Here's our ideal behaviour:

![keyboard-demo](./__lecture/assets/typeahead-keyboard-demo.gif)

We're already listening for keypresses, since we're calling the handler when the user presses "enter". Let's also add handlers for the up and down arrows:

```jsx
<input
  onKeyDown={ev => {
    // Switching from if/else to a "switch" statement,
    // since now we're handling multiple different values for
    // ev.key. This is an optional change, though; we could
    // still do it with if/else-if.
    switch (ev.key) {
      case "Enter": {
        handleSelect(ev.target.value);
        return;
      }
      case "ArrowUp": {
        // TODO: Handle moving the selection up
        return;
      }
      case "ArrowDown": {
        // TODO: Handle moving the selection down
        return;
      }
    }
  }}
/>
```

Right now, we don't really have a notion of which item is "selected"; we have a yellow hover state, but that's tracked in CSS.

We can think of the currently-selected item as some data that changes over time. And for dynamic data, we use React state.

Add a new state hook that manages the currently-selected index. Tweak that number when the user uses the arrow keys:

```jsx
const Typeahead = (
  {
    /* snip */
  }
) => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("");
  const [selectedSuggestionIndex, setSelectedSuggestionIndex] = React.useState(
    0
  );

  return (
    /* snip */
    <input
      onKeyDown={ev => {
        switch (ev.key) {
          case "Enter": {
            handleSelect(ev.target.value);
            return;
          }
          case "ArrowUp": {
            // TODO: Handle moving the selection up
            setSelectedSuggestionIndex(selectedSuggestionIndex - 1);
          }
          case "ArrowDown": {
            // TODO: Handle moving the selection down
            setSelectedSuggestionIndex(selectedSuggestionIndex + 1);
          }
        }
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

Earlier, we suggested adding a hover state to each list item. Let's remove that; instead, the yellow background will be managed through React, based on the currently-selected index.

There is a way to set dynamic styles using the `styled` helper, but inline styles are a simpler strategy in these cases:

```jsx
const isSelected = /*
  Figure this out, based on the React state
  and the current index in the array */;

<Suggestion
  key={suggestion.id}
  style={{
    background: isSelected ? 'hsla(50deg, 100%, 80%, 0.25)' : 'transparent',
  }}
```

We want to make it so that mousing over a list item causes it to be selected, replicating the hover state. Use an `onMouseEnter` event to set the React state.

Items should now be selectable both with a mouse as well as with a keyboard.

# Stretch Goals

## Stretch Goal 1: Wrapping up keyboard support

There's two more tasks we should complete, to call this component keyboard-usable:

- When there are no provided suggestions - either because the user hasn't typed anything yet, or they've typed a string that doesn't match any strings - we shouldn't tweak the selected index. Perform that check before updating the state
- On `Escape`, close the typeahead dropdown. HINT: You'll need another piece of React state to manage this.
- Clamp the selected index to the acceptable range of values; tapping "UpArrow" when you're on the first item shouldn't do anything.

Implement these enhancements.

## Stretch Goal 2: Screen readers

We tackled keyboard navigation, but screen readers are a bit of a different ballgame.

Follow the example on this page:

https://haltersweb.github.io/Accessibility/autocomplete.html
HINT: Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the different elements.

Try and use the Typeahead exclusively through your computer's screen reader. Your task will be complete when you can select items from the typeahead without looking at your screen.

Screen readers:

- Windows: NVDA, https://www.nvaccess.org/download/
- MacOS: VoiceOver, built into the computer
- Linux: Orca, https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/

## Stretch Goal 3: Grouping by category

Some typeaheads will group by category, like this:

![grouped](./__lecture/assets/grouped-by-cat.png)

Notice how the first _two_ books share a heading, "In Science Fiction & Fantasy". The challenging part of this stretch goal is to structure the rendered output in such a way that items sharing the same category are grouped.

HINT: One strategy is to create your own data structure, like this:

```js
const groupedSuggestions = [
  {
    categoryName: "Science Fiction & Fantasy",
    suggestions: [
      {
        /* Book 1 */
      },
      {
        /* Book 2 */
      }
    ]
  }
];
```

Then, you can use _nested .map calls_ to iterate first through every group, and then through every suggestion in every group.
